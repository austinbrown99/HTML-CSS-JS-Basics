                    Northern Kentucky has become a haven for cyclist in Cincinnati.
                    It allows riders to escape the crazy urban sprawl of the city and experience some rural and hilly
                    rides.
                    There is still a good diversity of riding in Northern Kentucky.
                    You can ride flat roads along the Ohio river or along Liking river which is a popular route to take
                    back
                    into the city.
                    It is also not too rural where there are no available pitstops, as there are plenty of gas stations
                    and
                    convenience stores.
                </p>

                    Needing a change in scenery, I chose to drive down and start my ride in Alexandria. It seemed like a
                    good place to start from given how easy it was to get there. I would come to learn that Alexandria
                    is on
                    top of a hill meaning the end of the ride would be uphill, which is not ideal. I spent a good amount
                    of
                    time creating this route, which most of the inspiration came from Jake Henningsen, who can be
                    considered
                    the king of this area being at the top of almost every KOM list. As you can see from the elevation
                    map,
                    there was not too much time spent on flat roads. It was mostly always up and down. The weather was
                    perfect, starting out a bit chilly, but warming up quickly when the sun rose. When there are little
                    to
                    no clouds I know it is going to be a good ride.
                </p>

                    I have learned that bonking is what will make a good ride miserable. That is why I included 3 stops
                    in
                    this ride. I probably could have gotten away with only 2 stops as I was suprised how fast I came
                    uppon
                    my second stop. But I was happy with the stops to refill water and talk with very nice people at a
                    store. The only bad thing about this ride was the dogs. 3 times I had to sprint away from angry
                    dogs.
                    The most
                    memorable one being when the dog broke the collar that he was chained to and chased me. I hope to be
                    able to complete this route again in the near future.
